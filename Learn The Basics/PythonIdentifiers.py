'''A Python identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, class, module or other object.
 An identifier starts with a letter A to Z or a to z or an underscore (_) followed by zero or more letters,
   underscores and digits (0 to 9).'''

#Python does not allow punctuation characters such as @, $, and % within identifiers.


#Python is a case sensitive programming language. 
#Thus, Manpower and manpower are two different identifiers in Python.
